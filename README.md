This is an efi shell application.
This app could dump setup item's value in shell.

We could using hii to get the setup item's name, offset and variable name/guid in NVRAM.
By this way, I could
1. Using HII Protocol to get the required information.
2. Get the setup item's value from NVRAM.

Todo:
1. Add set behavior.
